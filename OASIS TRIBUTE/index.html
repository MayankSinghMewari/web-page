        <h2>The Genius Behind Relativity</h2>
        <p>
          Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. His theory of relativity, particularly the equation E=mcÂ², revolutionized physics and opened the doors to a new era of scientific exploration.

        <h2>Imagination and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          Albert Einstein once said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
        </p>
        <p>
          Einstein's brilliance reminds us to embrace curiosity and nurture our imagination, propelling us to new frontiers of knowledge and understanding.
